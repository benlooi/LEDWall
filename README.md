#LED Wall Project

A project to build an LED wall with 722 WS2811 string leds.
Hooked up to 3 exercise bikes with reed switches, so that the mileage appears on the LED wall as participants cycle.

3 bars are displayed to indicate each bike's progress towards 3km.

Special thanks to Aaron Liddiment for his LEDMatrix and LEDText library.
